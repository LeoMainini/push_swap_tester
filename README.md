# PUSH_SWAP TESTER

This is a simple benchmark script for Push_Swap

Push_Swap is a project where you  will need to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. 

To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## Functionality

Run the helper script for information of the script.

There is no setup required, just clone the git in the root of your push_swap folder, or wherever your push_swap binary is, and run the script

For debugging purposes or if you feel the numbers arent what they should be, run help.sh to get more detailed information
